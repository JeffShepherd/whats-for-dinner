## **What's For Dinner?**

Whatâ€™s for dinner? *The ultimate question.* We built an app that helps users choose a dish and put together meals.


#### **Instructions for running and viewing the project:**

The app can be accessed by following these instructions:

1. Clone the repository: ```git clone git@github.com:JeffShepherd/whats-for-dinner.git```
2. Open the index.html file in a browser: ```open index.html```

#### **Features:**

* A user can select a recipe type, and have the app generate a random suggestion of meal from that type.
* Ability to select an entire meal, which will display a random side, main dish, and dessert.
* Users are able to click "Add A Recipe", which allows them to add their own recipes to the existing list of suggestions.

#### **Technologies:**

* Javascript
* HTML5
* CSS


#### **Future additions:**
The following features should be added into future versions of the app:
* Make page more responsive to smaller screen sizes.
* Add animations to button on click.


#### Original Challenge (via Turing School of Software and Design):

What's for dinner? The ultimate question. You will be building an app that helps users choose a recipe and put together meals. 

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/dinner.html).
